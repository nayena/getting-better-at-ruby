# Getting Better at Ruby

I am a self-taught developer and have always been blessed with the ability
to make things work (after a lot of googling). Because of my way of learning
things, I've always had a tendency to jump in the deep and and figure a way
to dig myself out from there.

This repository is an attempt to plan out and document my journey around
learning the fundamentals. Hopefully I will pick up a lot of tricks along the
way.

The style and structure is heavily inspired by [fpsvogel/learn-ruby](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby)
and the roadmaps at [roadmap.sh]( https://roadmap.sh/). A lot of the CS
specific stuff is inspired by [jwasham's brilliant coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).
